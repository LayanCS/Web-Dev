          <h2>3.2.1 input Type color</h2>
          The color input type (Fig. 3.1, lines 20–21) enables the user to enter a
          color. At the time of this writing, most browsers render the color input
          type as a text field in which the user can enter a hexadecamal code or a
          color name. In the future, when you click a color input, browsers will
          likely display a color picker similar to the Microsoft Windows color
          dialog shown in Fig. 3.2.

          <h2>autofocus Attribute</h2>
          The autofocus attribute (Fig. 3.1, line 20)—an optional attribute that can
          be used in only one input element on a form—automatically gives the focus
          to the input element, allowing the user to begin typing in that element
          immediately. Figure 3.3 shows auto- focus on the color element—the first
          input element in our form—as rendered in Chrome. You do not need to
          include autofocus in your forms.

          <h2>Validation</h2>

          Traditionally it’s been difficult to validate user input, such as ensuring that
          an e-mail ad- dress, URL, date or time is entered in the proper format. The new
          HTML 5 input types are self validating on the client side, eliminating the need
          to add complicated JavaScript code to your web pages to validate user input,
          reducing the amount of invalid data sub- mitted and consequently reducing
          Internet traffic between the server and the client to cor- rect invalid input.
          The server should still validate all user input.
          When a user enters data into a form then submits the form (in this example, by
          clicking the Submit button), the browser immediately checks the self-validating
          elements to ensure that the data is correct. For example, if a user enters an
          incorrect hexadecimal color value when using a browser that renders the color
          elements as a text field (e.g., Chrome), a callout pointing to the element will
          appear, indicating that an invalid value was entered (Fig. 3.4). Figure 3.5 lists
          each of the new HTML5 input types and provides examples of the proper formats
          required for each type of data to be valid.
